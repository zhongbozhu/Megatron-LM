"""Colocated feature transport for packed decoders with runtime context parallelism.

The boundary is explicitly differentiated: ``forward`` returns a detached leaf;
``backward`` implements the transpose of the saved route and returns the local
encoder-output gradient. The caller accumulates all rounds before backpropagating
through its original encoder outputs. Plain distributed P2P is not autograd-aware.
